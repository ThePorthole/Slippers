## Prelude

Slippers made his way to Waterdeep, seeking information about his mother. He quickly realized that navigating the city would be difficult, but he was resourceful and determined.

While searching for clues, he crossed paths with a member of the Zhentarim, a man named Ralgar. The Zhentarim were known for their ability to gather information and Slippers saw an opportunity to work with them to uncover the truth about his past.

Slippers took on various jobs for the Zhentarim, using his skills to complete tasks that required stealth and precision. He quickly earned a reputation as a reliable and skilled operative, and was soon officially indoctrinated into the organization.

Through his work with the Zhentarim, Slippers was able to gather information about his mother's past. He learned that she was an elf, and that she had disappeared under mysterious circumstances. While he was grateful for the information, Slippers was left with more questions than answers.

Slippers remained committed to his work with the Zhentarim. He saw the organization as a way to make a difference in Waterdeep, and he enjoyed the sense of purpose it gave him. From that day forward, he continued to work for the Zhentarim, using his skills to further their goals and protect their interests.
