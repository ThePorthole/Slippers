## Opportunity!

Day has barely broken, but Ralgar sends word. Slippers should come quickly. Something about a golden opportunity. Dress well, but be ready for a long journey. Come up the High to that spot on Thunderstaff.  

Slippers knew this must be something big. And the moment he saw Ralgar's face, he knew he was right. Breathlessly, Ralgar fills him in on the situation and his still-evolving plan. There's some sort of caravan forming at the Upper Towers. Not really a caravan, maybe. At least, not like the ones that form at the South because they go south. This one looks almost like an expedition, going north. But with just a few armed escorts, seemingly plucked from all over. So not a patrol. A special mission? 

Ralgar is convinced that the "caravan" is headed to the ruins of Leilon. He's been hearing rumors for a while about a big Alliance-led effort to rebuild the city and reopen its port. Whatever is happening, he needs to know. The Zhentarim will need to know. But Ralgar is too notorious to join the caravan and not skilled enough to tail it. That's where Slippers comes in. Some way or another, Slippers needs to go where the caravan goes and figure out what's happening.

Slippers nods. Ralgar claps him on the shoulder and gives him a proud look before striding off. Slippers jogs down Thunderstaff Way, then slows to a brisk walk before turning north onto the High Road. The Upper Towers grow larger and he can begin to see the caravan forming in the yard of the guard barracks. Every step closer reveals more detail. Slippers drinks it in, mentally cataloging who seems to be packing, who seems to be leaving, what they are wearing, what they seem to be bringing, who's in charge, who is armed, who isn't. Strategies are crystallizing. A plan is forming.
